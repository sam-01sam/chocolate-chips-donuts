In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (from the flour through to the salt) using a hand whisk. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, egg, buttermilk & vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk to combine. Once almost combined, fold in the chocolate chips using a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Spoon the batter into your doughnut pan until each cavity is 2/3 or 3/4 full. Alternatively, spoon the batter into a large ziplock bag, zip closed the bag and cut one of the bottom corners off. Use the ziplock bag to pipe the batter into the doughnut cavities. Bake doughnuts for 8-10 minutes, until they lightly spring back when touched with your finger tip. Allow doughnuts to cool in their pan for 10 minutes, then remove and continue to cool on a wire rack. While the doughnuts are cooling, make the chocolate glaze. In a microwave safe bowl melt together the chocolate chips, butter & cream in short 30 second bursts until the chocolate is melted. Alternatively, melt them together over a double boiler. Once the chocolate is melted, stir in the corn syrup. Dip the tops of the doughnuts into the glaze, and allow for the glaze to set with the doughnuts on a wire rack
